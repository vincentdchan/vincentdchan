# I am Vincent Chan

I am a developer living in Shenzhen. I am interested in Compiler technology, Computer Graphics, Operating systems.

## Projects

[CubyText](https://github.com/vincentdchan/CubyText/import) is an open-source knowledge management app. (2022)

[Blocky editor](https://github.com/vincentdchan/blocky-editor) is an editor built with blocks. (2022)

[LichenScirpt](https://github.com/lichenscript/lichenscript) is a lightweight language compiled to JavaScript/C. (2022)

[Esreverse](https://diverse.space/esreverse/) is a reverse tool for Web.
It can reverse async/await/generator syntaxes in minifed code. (2021)

[Jetpack](https://github.com/vincentdchan/jetpack.js) is an extremely fast JavaScript bundler written in C++. It can be compiled into a binary without any dependencies. It's portable, fast, and solid.

[PoloDB](https://github.com/vincentdchan/PoloDB) is an embedded JSON-based database written in Rust. It's designed to be lightweight and safe. It supports query semantics like MongoDB and WAL transactions.

Sometimes, I will do some "hacking" on existing systems.

- I [forked the OCaml](https://github.com/vincentdchan/ocaml) to make it compiled to WebAssembly. So you can [run the OCaml language in the browser](https://diverse.space/ocamlrun-wasm-demo/).

- I wrote a [CMake file](https://github.com/vincentdchan/quickjs) for QuickJS so that you can compile it with MSVC.

- I wrote a [Node.js extension](https://github.com/vincentdchan/node-xattr), which can help you manipulate xattr on macOS.

Also, I participated GSoC in 2018. I wrote a [webpack plugin](https://github.com/vincentdchan/webpack-deep-scope-analysis-plugin) to help tree-shaking.

## Writing

I will keep writing on [Medium](https://okcdz.medium.com/) in English.

I have [a blog in Chinese](https://diverse.space/).

Sometimes I will share my view on Twitter.
If you have any ideas about my project, send an email to [okcdz@diverse.space](mailto:okcdz@diverse.space), or submit an issue.
